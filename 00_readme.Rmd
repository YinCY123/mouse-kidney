# data
- GSE150338: microdissected mouse tubules sequencing data, for inferring tubular single cells in GSE129798 comes from which microdissected region.
- GSE129798: whole mice kidney single cell sequencing data, with regional information  
- GSE146912: mice glomerular sequencing data  
- GSE175421: mouse sensory neurons from L1-L6  
- GSE78845: mouse sympathetic neurons from T1-T12  


**Notes**  
> some cells are remove from data set, such as some immune cell in GSE175421 are removed as it has little interest for our integrated dataset.
